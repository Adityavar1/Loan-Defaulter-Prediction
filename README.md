Preprocessed the data and imputed numerical columns by IterativeImputer and categorical features by KNNImputer. Using correlation matrix, identified and dropped the variables undergoing dummy variable trap from the dataset.	Implemented XGBClassifier, tuning parameters using GridSearchCV and calculated feature importance using Fscore.	Performed KFold cross-validation and obtained mean accuracy of 98.45% and validation mean F2 score of 0.84.
